                "question": "What is the purpose of this app?",
                "answer": "It helps children learn English through fun stories. Words are seen in context, learned intuitively, and reinforced through repetition."
            },
            "q2": {
                "question": "What does the AI do here?",
                "answer": "It analyzes which words the child struggles with, provides simple explanations, and suggests new stories appropriate for their level. The content is adapted to the child's learning pace."
            },
            "q3": {
                "question": "How much time is enough to use it daily?",
                "answer": "5–10 minutes a day is sufficient. Even a short story is effective for regular learning."
            },
            "q4": {
                "question": "What age group are the stories suitable for?",
                "answer": "The stories are presented according to the child's age and level. The app determines the level at the beginning and adjusts the difficulty based on progress."
            },
            "q5": {
                "question": "How does the child learn unfamiliar words?",
                "answer": "When the child taps on an unfamiliar word, its meaning, a simple explanation, and the correct pronunciation are shown. This way, the word is both read and heard."
            },
            "q6": {
                "question": "Is an internet connection required?",
                "answer": "Previously downloaded stories can be read offline. An internet connection is required for new content and updates."

                "question": "Is the app free?",

            },
            "q8": {
                "question": "Can the stories be listened to?",
                "answer": "Yes. The stories can be listened to with correct pronunciation. This way, both reading and listening skills develop together."
            },
            "q9": {
                "question": "Can the learned words be tracked?",
                "answer": "Yes. The learned words are recorded and planned to be repeated at certain intervals. This way, forgetting can be reduced."
            },
            "q10": {
                "question": "How long does it take to see progress?",
                "answer": "With regular use, progress can be noticeable in a short time. As reading habits increase, vocabulary and comprehension skills improve."
